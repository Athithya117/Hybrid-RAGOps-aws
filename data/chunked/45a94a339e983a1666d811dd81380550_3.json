See [Tested OS and Platforms](https://nginx.org/en/#tested_os_and_platforms) for a full list of compatible systems.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> While nearly all popular Linux-based operating systems are distributed with a community version of nginx, we highly advise installation and usage of official [packages](https://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html) or sources from this repository. Doing so ensures that you're using the most recent release or source code, including the latest feature-set, fixes and security patches.\n\n## Modules\nNGINX is comprised of individual modules, each extending core functionality by providing additional, configurable features. See \"Modules reference\" at the bottom of [nginx documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) for a complete list of official modules.\n\nNGINX modules can be built and distributed as static or dynamic modules. Static modules are defined at build-time, compiled, and distributed in the resulting binaries. See [Dynamic Modules](#dynamic-modules) for more information on how they work, as well as, how to obtain, install, and configure them.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> You can issue the following command to see which static modules your NGINX binaries were built with:\n```bash\nnginx -V\n```\n> See [Configuring the build](#configuring-the-build) for information on how to include specific Static modules into your nginx build.",
