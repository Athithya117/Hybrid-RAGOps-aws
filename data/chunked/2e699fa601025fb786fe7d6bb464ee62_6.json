Page-level chunking demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to both token-based chunking and section-level chunking. Looking at the dataset-specific findings, we can see clear evidence of this pattern. Some financial datasets, such as KG-RAG, achieved best performance with page-level chunking (0.520), while others, such as FinanceBench, performed best with 1,024-token chunks (0.579) but still showed strong results with page-level chunking (0.566). The RAGBattlePacket also showed excellent performance with page-level chunking (0.790), very close to its best result with 1,024-token chunks (0.804).**Inconsistent patterns even within similar document types**: Even within the same document category, optimal chunking strategies varied significantly. This observation is particularly evident in financial documents, where we observed three different optimal strategies across three datasets: FinanceBench performed best with 1,024-token chunks (0.579), Earnings with 512-token chunks (0.681), and KG-RAG with page-level chunking (0.520). These variations suggest that, beyond broad content categories, specific document structures, information density, and the nature of queries significantly influence the optimal chunking strategy. This highlights the importance of testing multiple chunking approaches, even when working with similar document types.**Extreme chunk sizes show diminishing returns**: Very small (128 tokens) and very large (2,048 tokens) chunks generally underperformed medium-sized chunks. Across most datasets, the extreme ends of chunk sizes showed lower performance. For KG-RAG, 128-token chunks had the worst performance (0.421), significantly lower than other strategies. Similarly, 2048-token chunks underperformed 1024-token chunks for RAGBattlePacket (0.749 vs 0.804) and FinanceBench (0.506 vs 0.579). This suggests a “sweet spot” in the middle chunk size range for most document types.**Performance curves aren’t always linear**: For some datasets, performance didn’t increase or decrease linearly with chunk size. Earnings showed a non-linear pattern where performance peaked at",
