  "text": "A. Offline indexing and alignment: index passages and extract triples from passages (using automatic triple extraction) and align passages with triples for fast linking during graph expansion.\n\nB. Base retrieval: apply a cheap base retriever (BM25 or other) to get initial passages given the query.\n\nC. LLM reader: read retrieved passages to extract proximal triples (triples most relevant to the query) — the LLM acts as a triple extractor and selector.\n\nD. SyncGE graph expansion: link proximal triples to their nearest real triples in the triple index and expand the graph using diverse triple beam search to find multi-hop passage candidates.\n\nE. Combine and rerank: combine the base and expanded passages (RRF-style combination is used by authors) and present to the LLM reasoner.\n\nF. Gist memory: accumulate proximal triples across iterations to form a compact working memory used by the reasoner.\n\nG. Agent loop: the LLM assesses whether the current gist memory suffices to answer; if not, it rewrites the query for the next iteration and the cycle repeats until stopping conditions or maximum steps.\n\n---\n\n3. KEY COMPONENTS — DETAILED\n\n---\n\nA. Triple extraction and index alignment\n\n* Passages are processed offline to extract triples (subject, predicate, object).\n* A retrieval index is maintained for both passages and extracted triples; the system can link a \"proximal triple\" proposed by the LLM back to the real triples and their associated passages. This alignment builds the graph substrate used by SyncGE.\n\nB. SyncGE (Synchronized Graph Expansion)\n\n* Core idea: use the LLM to find initial nodes (proximal triples) and then expand the graph by exploring neighboring triples, using a diverse beam search that penalizes redundant expansion and rewards diverse multi-hop paths.",
