These include:\n\nAltering the density and brightness\n\nChanging the plane of the image from axial to sagittal or coronal\n\nProducing three dimensional images\n\nDemonstrating detailed angiography\n\nThe Image can  be stored on the computer’s hard drive or an external medium such as a versatile optical disk or as a hard copy on a photosensitive film\n\n## Slide 26\n\nHighlights of Development Trends\n\nInstallation of first clinical scanner at Atkinson-Morley’s hospital by Hounsfield and Ambrose\n\nConsisted of an x-ray tube and two detectors\n\nInitially the scan time was about 5 minutes per slice\n\nDigital data was recorded on a magnetic tape and was sent to a factory for overnight reconstruction\n\nUpon return to the hospital the images were printed as an array of numbers\n\n## Slide 27\n\nThe first publication of a grey scale image by Hounsfield and Ambrose\n\nThe image was of a brain of a living  patient\n\nShowed a cystic lesion in the frontal lobe\n\nThis was followed by a popular exhibit at the 1972 RSNA  (Radiological Society of North America) annual meeting  in Chicago\n\n## Slide 28\n\nThe original scanner was updated with its own microprocessor\n\nIt reduced the data acquisition time and the reconstruction time to 4.5 minutes each.\n\nThe smallest detail that could e visualized was about 3mm\n\nFist whole body scanner installed at Georgetown University Washington\n\nIntroduction of the 2nd generation scanners using 3 detectors.",
