  "text": "* Core idea: use the LLM to find initial nodes (proximal triples) and then expand the graph by exploring neighboring triples, using a diverse beam search that penalizes redundant expansion and rewards diverse multi-hop paths.\n* SyncGE differs from naive graph expansion in that the LLM is used to select starting nodes (higher quality seeds), enabling better single-iteration performance.\n\nC. Diverse Triple Beam Search (intuition)\n\n* Maintain a beam of candidate triple-paths. At each step, expand by neighboring triples, score candidate paths against the query (embedding similarity plus scoring function), and apply a diversity penalty to encourage varied paths. Keep top-B beams up to a maximum path length.\n* The final beams map back to passages via triple-to-passage links.\n\nD. Gist Triple Memory\n\n* A compact accumulator of proximal triples learned in one or a few iterations (authors draw a biomimetic analogy to hippocampal gist memory). The gist memory is used both for reasoning and for rewriting the query when more retrieval is needed.\n\nE. Agent Reasoner and Stop criterion\n\n* The LLM reads the combined passages and gist memory and decides whether the answer is ready. If not, it emits a rewritten query intended to retrieve the next missing piece of evidence. The agent stops when the reasoner judges the accumulated evidence sufficient or when maximum iterations are reached.\n\n---\n\n4. ALGORITHMIC DETAILS & PSEUDOCODE (paraphrased)\n\n---\n\nThe following pseudocode is a conceptual paraphrase of the authors' algorithm.\n\nfunction GeAR(query, max\\_steps=4):\ngist\\_memory = \\[]\ncurrent\\_query = query\nstep = 1\nwhile step <= max\\_steps:\nbase\\_passages = base\\_retrieve(current\\_query)            # BM25 / ColBERT / hybrid",
