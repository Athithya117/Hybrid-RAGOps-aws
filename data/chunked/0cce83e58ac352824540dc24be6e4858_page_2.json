However, this method needed a equally represented, a technique called SMOTE was used\n\nlot of data, which isn’t always easy to get. to balance the data.\n\nIn [4], researchers used Convolutional Neural Networks C.

Several types of classification models were tested and\n\nThis method was very accurate, but it needed special compared:\n\ncameras, which aren’t always available to small farmers.\n\n- Logistic Regression as a basic linear model.\n\nOverall, these studies show that while different models\n\nhave worked well, most of them are only useful for a - Support Vector Machine (SVM) for handling complex\n\nspecific disease, use expensive tools, or need a lot of data patterns.\n\ndata.\n\nThis means there’s a need for a system that can handle - Random Forest, which works well with many types of\n\nmany diseases, is cheap to use, and can work with simple data, especially when there are many categories.\n\nfeatures like the animal’s symptoms, behavior, and the\n\nillness. - XGBoost, which is efficient and accurate for prediction\n\nenvironment to predict\n\ntasks.\n\nIII.
