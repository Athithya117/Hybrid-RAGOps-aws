  "text": "* GeAR requires fewer iterations to reach high recall compared to iterative baselines. On MuSiQue, GeAR often achieves high retrieval quality in a single iteration.\n* Token usage: across repeated iterations, GeAR accumulates far fewer LLM input/output tokens than some iterative baselines in the reported experiments.\n\nPractical implication:\n\n* SyncGE increases offline work (indexing and triple extraction) but saves online LLM tokens and iterations at query time. This tradeoff favors scenarios where online LLM costs dominate.\n\n---\n\n9. QUALITATIVE EXAMPLES (illustrative)\n\n---\n\n* Case studies in the paper show GeAR recovering necessary multi-hop facts in fewer iterations than baselines. Example: a multi-hop question about a Nobel laureate's PhD institution â€” initial BM25 fetches general pages, SyncGE expands via triples to connect the laureate to PhD relations, gist memory collects the missing node, then the agent issues a rewritten query to locate the doctorate record and returns a confident, sourced answer.\n\n* The project page contains additional exemplars showing LLM-seeded triples and beam paths that lead to the final evidence.\n\n---\n\n10. LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK (authors' discussion)\n\n---\n\n* Scope limited to triple graphs derived from passages; richer graph construction (better entity disambiguation, knowledge graph completion) could boost performance further.\n\n* Dependence on triple extraction quality: noisy triple extraction or poor alignment can degrade graph expansion and retrieval quality. Authors discuss potential extractor improvements in the appendix.\n\n* Design choices such as the specific dense embedding model for path scoring could be replaced by alternative formulations (e.g., NLI scoring, stronger similarity models).\n\n* Very high-complexity or extremely sparse-evidence questions remain challenging; authors report best gains for low-to-moderate complexity multi-hop questions.\n\n---\n\n11.
