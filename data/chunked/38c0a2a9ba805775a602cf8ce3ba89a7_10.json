Demonstrations and proof-of-concepts showed how AI chains could craft targeted phishing, exploit tailoring and automated lateral movement, prompting calls for urgent investment in detection, AI-aware defenses, basic hygiene (patching, IAM) and industry governance to mitigate the emerging risk. | published_date: 2025-09-09T00:00:00Z | authors: ['security analysts', 'industry blogs'] | organizations: ['security vendors', 'cyber research community'] | tags: ['security', 'cybersecurity', 'agentic_ai', 'threat'] | category: security | severity: critical | location: None | related_ids: [] | references: [{'name': 'Security community reports', 'url': ''}] | created_at: 2025-09-10T06:30:00Z | updated_at: 2025-09-10T06:30:00Z",
