  "text": "## Slide 16\n\n1963- William Oldendorf\n\nAmerican neurologist at University of California\n\nFirst researcher to apply these construction techniques to the medical field.\n\nUsed a collimated source of gamma rays to scan a three dimensional object and reconstruct an image from that scan\n\nThe object was a small concentric ring of nails and one scan took one hour\n\n## Slide 17\n\n1963- Allen Cormack\n\nSouth African nuclear physicist at Tufts University in Massachutts.\n\nBuilt laboratory models of CT scanners\n\nLack of funds prevented the development of a production unit\n\nHis articles were published in the Journal of Applied Physics.\n\nThese expedited the research work of the next pioneer\n\n## Slide 18\n\n1967 – Godfry Hounsfield\n\nBritish research engineer with Central Research Laboratories at EMI (Electric and Musical Industries)  in London.\n\nWorked on digital pattern reconstruction techniques.\n\nConceived the idea of producing images of the humen body from a set of transmission measurements taken in a slice of an object.\n\nInitial plans were for whole body examinations, but\n\nUk Dept. of Health indicated the greatest potential of scanning the brain.\n\nThe first scanner used a gamma source with exposure times up to 9 days and reconstruction times of 2.5 hours per slice.\n\n## Slide 19\n\nThe first tissues used in these experiments was a bullock’s brain\n\nWorking with Dr. J.Ambrose, a consultant radiologist at Wimbledon’s Atkinson Morley’s Hospital, the first clinical scanner was installed there in September 1971\n\nFor his contribution to the science of diagnostic imaging, Hounsfield received\n\nthe MacRobert award from the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1972,\n\nthe Ziedses des Plantes Tomography Medal from Germany in 1974,\n\nThe Nobel Prize for medicine, together with Cormack in 1979\n\nDied in August 2004\n\n## Slide 20\n\nCT Gantry\n\nIn practice\nAPERTURE\nDETECTORS\nImPACT Course, Oct 05",
