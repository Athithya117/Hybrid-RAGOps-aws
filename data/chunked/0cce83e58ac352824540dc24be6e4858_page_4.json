Conclusion and Future Work\n\nmastitis in dairy cattle using machine learning\n\nThis paper introduced a machine learning system that\n\ntechniques,” International Journal of Computer\n\nhelps predict cattle diseases by using information about\n\nApplications, vol. 182, no. 7, pp. 1–6, Jul. 2018.\n\nthe animals' health, behavior, and their surroundings.\n\nFour different models were tested: Logistic Regression,\n\n[5] J. P. Singh, R. Kumar, and M. Singh, “Livestock\n\nDecision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector\n\ndisease detection using Internet of Things and machine\n\nMachine. The Random Forest model worked best,\n\nlearning,” in Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. on Computing,\n\ngiving higher accuracy and better overall performance,\n\nCommunication and Automation (ICCCA), Dec. 2019,\n\nmaking it the best choice for this task. The system also\n\ngives the top three possible disease predictions, which\n\nhelps farmers and vets make more reliable decisions.\n\n[6] A. Vaswani et al., “Attention is all you need,” in\n\nProc. Advances in Neural Information Processing\n\nThe system includes an easy-to-use interface made with\n\nSystems (NeurIPS), 2017, pp. 5998–6008.\n\nStreamlit and automatically creates reports with pictures\n\nrelated to specific diseases.\n\nThese features make the system useful in real situations.\n\nBecause it's easy to use and doesn't cost much, this\n\napproach could help reduce the number of sick cows,\n\nallow for earlier treatment, and support better ways of\n\nmanaging cattle.\n\nFor the future, we plan to add more diseases and\n\ndifferent environmental factors to the data.\n\nUsing deep learning techniques like Convolutional\n\nNeural Networks could improve the system's ability to\n\nrecognize diseases from images. We also want to\n\nconnect the system with IoT devices to monitor\n\nimportant signs and behaviors in real time. Working\n\nwith vets and farmers will help us test the system in real\n\nconditions and make sure it works well in practice…\n\nReferences\n\n[1] A. Kamilaris and F. X.
