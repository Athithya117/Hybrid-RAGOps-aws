Poor chunking leads to irrelevant results, inefficiency, and reduced business value. It determines how effectively relevant information is fetched for accurate AI responses. With so many options available—page-level, section-level, or token-based chunking with various sizes—how do you determine which approach works best for your specific use case? This blog post shares insights from our extensive experimentation across diverse datasets to help you optimize your retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system’s chunking strategy. ## Introduction Chunking is a critical preprocessing step in RAG pipelines. It involves splitting documents into smaller, manageable pieces that can be efficiently indexed, retrieved, and used as context during response generation. When done poorly, chunking can lead to irrelevant or incomplete responses, frustrating users and undermining trust in the system. It can also increase the computational burden by forcing the retriever or generator to process excessive or unnecessary information. On the other hand, a smart chunking strategy improves retrieval precision and contextual coherence, which directly enhances the quality of the generated answers. For users, this means faster, more accurate, and more helpful interactions. For businesses, it translates to higher user satisfaction, lower churn, and reduced operational costs due to more efficient resource utilization. In short, chunking isn’t just a technical detail—it’s a fundamental design choice that shapes the effectiveness of your entire RAG system. Our research evaluated different chunking strategies across multiple datasets to establish guidelines for selecting the optimal approach based on your specific content and use case. ## Experimental setup ### Chunking strategies tested We tested three primary chunking approaches to understand their impact on retrieval quality and response accuracy: **Token-based chunking**: Documents are split into fixed-size token chunks using content extracted by NVIDIA Ne",
