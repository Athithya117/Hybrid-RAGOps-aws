You may also choose to [build NGINX locally from source code](#building-from-source).\n\n## Stable and Mainline binaries\nNGINX binaries are built and distributed in two versions: stable and mainline. Stable binaries are built from stable branches and only contain critical fixes backported from the mainline version. Mainline binaries are built from the [master branch](https://github.com/nginx/nginx/tree/master) and contain the latest features and bugfixes. You'll need to [decide which is appropriate for your purposes](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/#choosing-between-a-stable-or-a-mainline-version).\n\n## Linux binary installation process\nThe NGINX binary installation process takes advantage of package managers native to specific Linux distributions. For this reason, first-time installations involve adding the official NGINX package repository to your system's package manager. Follow [these steps](https://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html) to download, verify, and install NGINX binaries using the package manager appropriate for your Linux distribution.\n\n### Upgrades\nFuture upgrades to the latest version can be managed using the same package manager without the need to manually download and verify binaries.\n\n## FreeBSD installation process\nFor more information on installing NGINX on FreeBSD system, visit https://nginx.org/en/docs/install.html",
