See [Tested OS and Platforms](https://nginx.org/en/#tested_os_and_platforms) for a full list of compatible systems.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> While nearly all popular Linux-based operating systems are distributed with a community version of nginx, we highly advise installation and usage of official [packages](https://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html) or sources from this repository. Doing so ensures that you're using the most recent release or source code, including the latest feature-set, fixes and security patches.\n\n## Modules\nNGINX is comprised of individual modules, each extending core functionality by providing additional, configurable features. See \"Modules reference\" at the bottom of [nginx documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) for a complete list of official modules.\n\nNGINX modules can be built and distributed as static or dynamic modules. Static modules are defined at build-time, compiled, and distributed in the resulting binaries. See [Dynamic Modules](#dynamic-modules) for more information on how they work, as well as, how to obtain, install, and configure them.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> You can issue the following command to see which static modules your NGINX binaries were built with:\n```bash\nnginx -V\n```\n> See [Configuring the build](#configuring-the-build) for information on how to include specific Static modules into your nginx build.", "token_count": 309, "embedding": null, "file_type": "text/markdown", "source_url": "s3://e2e-rag-system-42/data/raw/mds/nginx.md", "page_number": null, "slide_range": null, "row_range": null, "token_range": null, "audio_range": null, "timestamp": "2025-09-23T01:38:15.005165Z", "parser_version": "markdown-it-py-v1", "tags": [], "layout_tags": [], "used_ocr": false, "heading_path": ["How it works"], "headings": ["How it works", "Modules"], "line_range": [45, 61]},{"document_id": "45a94a339e983a1666d811dd81380550", "chunk_id": "45a94a339e983a1666d811dd81380550_4", "chunk_type": "md_section", "text": "## Configurations\nNGINX is highly flexible and configurable. Provisioning the software is achieved via text-based config file(s) accepting parameters called \"[Directives](https://nginx.org/en/docs/dirindex.html)\". See [Configuration File's Structure](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html#conf_structure) for a comprehensive description of how NGINX configuration files work.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The set of directives available to your distribution of NGINX is dependent on which [modules](#modules) have been made available to it.\n\n## Runtime\nRather than running in a single, monolithic process, NGINX is architected to scale beyond Operating System process limitations by operating as a collection of processes. They include:\n- A \"master\" process that maintains worker processes, as well as, reads and evaluates configuration files.\n- One or more \"worker\" processes that process data (eg. HTTP requests).\n\nThe number of [worker processes](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#worker_processes) is defined in the configuration file and may be fixed for a given configuration or automatically adjusted to the number of available CPU cores. In most cases, the latter option optimally balances load across available system resources, as NGINX is designed to efficiently distribute work across all worker processes.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Processes synchronize data through shared memory. For this reason, many NGINX directives require the allocation of shared memory zones. As an example, when configuring [rate limiting](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html#limit_req), connecting clients may need to be tracked in a [common memory zone](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html#limit_req_zone) so all worker processes can know how many times a particular client has accessed the server in a span of time.", "token_count": 388, "embedding": null, "file_type": "text/markdown", "source_url": "s3://e2e-rag-system-42/data/raw/mds/nginx.md", "page_number": null, "slide_range": null, "row_range": null, "token_range": null, "audio_range": null, "timestamp": "2025-09-23T01:38:15.006021Z", "parser_version": "markdown-it-py-v1", "tags": [], "layout_tags": [], "used_ocr": false, "heading_path": [], "headings": ["Configurations", "Runtime"], "line_range": [62, 78]},{"document_id": "45a94a339e983a1666d811dd81380550", "chunk_id": "45a94a339e983a1666d811dd81380550_5", "chunk_type": "md_section", "text": "# Downloading and installing\nFollow these steps to download and install precompiled NGINX binaries. You may also choose to [build NGINX locally from source code](#building-from-source).\n\n## Stable and Mainline binaries\nNGINX binaries are built and distributed in two versions: stable and mainline. Stable binaries are built from stable branches and only contain critical fixes backported from the mainline version. Mainline binaries are built from the [master branch](https://github.com/nginx/nginx/tree/master) and contain the latest features and bugfixes. You'll need to [decide which is appropriate for your purposes](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/#choosing-between-a-stable-or-a-mainline-version).\n\n## Linux binary installation process\nThe NGINX binary installation process takes advantage of package managers native to specific Linux distributions. For this reason, first-time installations involve adding the official NGINX package repository to your system's package manager.

For additional information, please see [nginx for Windows](https://nginx.org/en/docs/windows.html).\n\n## Dynamic modules\nNGINX version 1.9.11 added support for [Dynamic Modules](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#load_module). Unlike Static modules, dynamically built modules can be downloaded, installed, and configured after the core NGINX binaries have been built.
